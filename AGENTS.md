# AGENTS.md

Notion connector package for Harn webhooks, polling, and outbound API calls.

Shared connector authoring rules live in the Harn guide:

- [Connector authoring guide](https://github.com/burin-labs/harn/blob/main/docs/src/connectors/authoring.md)

Put shared connector guidance in the Harn guide and keep only
provider-specific notes and local hazards here.

`CLAUDE.md` points here. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

## Provider notes

- Outbound REST endpoint definitions belong in `notion-sdk-harn`; this
  connector wraps that SDK and should not duplicate its generated API surface.
- Signed webhooks use `x-notion-signature`; subscription verification events
  intentionally do not require a signature.
- Polling supports database and data source resources and should preserve
  Harn-managed cursor/state handoff across ticks.
- `harn-notion-connector` must not be imported from `notion-sdk-harn`; the
  dependency only flows from connector to SDK.

## Pull request titles

Use `[Area] Sentence case`. The area is one of `Connector`, `CI`, or `Docs`.

- `[Connector] Reject webhook deliveries with a stale timestamp`
- `[CI] Repin the shared Harn package workflow`
- `[Docs] Describe the poll cursor contract`

Keep the title on one line, under about 70 characters. Say what changed, not
which files moved. Capitalize the first word after the bracket and leave the
rest in sentence case.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` states the contribution policy for this repository.

## Ecosystem working agreement

- Pursue the ambitious product outcome; make the seams boring with small typed
  interfaces, explicit invariants, and deterministic projections.
- Give each behavior one semantic owner. Generate or parity-test other surfaces
  instead of maintaining competing implementations.
- Work autonomously inside approved scope. Pause for destructive, production,
  high-spend, ambiguous, or authority-expanding actions—not routine reversible work.
- Treat stop, wait, stand down, and pivot as control events for long-lived work.
- Match evidence to the claim: exercise the canonical user path, state the
  falsifier, verify liveness and recovery, and record residual blind spots.
- "Ship" means landed on main with required deploy and post-merge checks complete.
